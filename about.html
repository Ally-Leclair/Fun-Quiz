      Thanks for looking at my portfolio! 
      A little about me I was born in Center Moriches, New York and later moved to Knoxville,Tennessee. 
      I am currently a rising senior in high school and play trombone in marching band. I love to draw, play
      with my pets and hang out with my friends.
